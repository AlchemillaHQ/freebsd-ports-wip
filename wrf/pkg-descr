The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model is a next-generation mesoscale
numerical weather prediction system designed to serve both operational
forecasting and atmospheric research needs. It features multiple dynamical
cores, a 3-dimensional variational (3DVAR) data assimilation system, and a
software architecture allowing for computational parallelism and system
extensibility. WRF is suitable for a broad spectrum of applications across
scales ranging from meters to thousands of kilometers.
