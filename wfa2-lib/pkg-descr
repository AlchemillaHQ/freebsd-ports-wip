The wavefront alignment (WFA) algorithm is an exact gap-affine
algorithm that takes advantage of homologous regions between the
sequences to accelerate the alignment process. Unlike to traditional
dynamic programming algorithms that run in quadratic time, the WFA runs
in time O(ns+s^2), proportional to the sequence length n and the
alignment score s, using O(s^2) memory (or O(s) using the
ultralow/BiWFA mode). Moreover, the WFA algorithm exhibits simple
computational patterns that the modern compilers can automatically
vectorize for different architectures without adapting the code. To
intuitively illustrate why the WFA algorithm is so interesting, look at
the following figure. The left panel shows the cells computed by a
classical dynamic programming based algorithm (like Smith-Waterman or
Needleman Wunsch). In contrast, the right panel shows the cells
computed by the WFA algorithm to obtain the same result (i.e., the
optimal alignment).
