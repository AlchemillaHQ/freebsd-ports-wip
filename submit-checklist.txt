Distfile
    If maintaining the source, clean up and reroll distfile

Makefile:
    Check all installed scripts for proper shebang line
	(DEVELOPER=yes in /etc/make.conf will enable QA tests to detect this)
    
    portsnap fetch update

    Merge latest changes in committed port into development port

    # Created by: First-name Last-name <email>
    # $FreeBSD$
    
    USE_GITHUB, SF, DISTVERSIONPREFIX, etc. if possible
    
    Check use of each LOCALBASE and PREFIX
    Convert /usr/wip and ../.. to ${PORTSDIR}
    Use ${PORTNAME}, ${PORTVERSION}, etc in body wherever possible
    Check categories
    
    Check/correct MASTER_SITES
	Use https if possible to protect download stream from hackers
    
    MAINTAINER=     email
    
    Check comment

    Add LICENSE (after COMMENT)
    
    Check versions of all depends
	Be as generic as possible
	Use USES or USE_* variables wherever possible
	New LIB_DEPENDS format: libname.so
    
    OPTIONS
	All non-options macros before bsd.options.mk
	Add DOCS to OPTIONS_DEFINE if needed
	Remove PORT_OPTIONS:MDOCS checks (automatic with staging)
	Check OPTIONS_DEFINE for standards like MYSQL, etc.
    
    If installing config files in PREFIX/etc:
	suffix with .sample
	delete real config file on deinstall if identical to .sample
    
    Man pages
	Remove MANx macros from Makefile (obsolete with staging)
	Add to pkg-plist
    
    Bump PORT_REVISION if not changing VERSION
	Otherwise, remove PORT_REVISION
    
    Add PORT_EPOCH if downgrading

    Remove MAKE_JOBS_UNSAFE if possible
    
    Replace NOPORTDOCS, etc. with PORT_OPTIONS:MDOC
    
    Remove cat pkg-message if present
    
Carefully inspect pkg-plist

Carefully check patches

Check pkg-descr
    spell-check
    space, not tab after WWW

Make sure there's a man page

Remove any extraneous files from port framework

Test on all available platforms.  Do the following IN ORDER:

    Add DEVELOPER=yes to /etc/make.conf to enable QA tests

    reinstall-wip-port -u -r ports-mgmt/port-dev
    port-check

    test with NOPORT* (whatever is in pkg-plist)

Test with poudriere to ensure all depends are installed by the port

Generate unified diff for updates, shar file for new ports
    (port-diff or port-shar scripts from ports-mgmt/port-dev)

Carefully inspect diff or shar

Follow porter's handbook to submit new port or update.
