Distfile
    If maintaining the source, clean up and reroll distfile

Makefile:
    Check all installed scripts for proper shebang line
	(DEVELOPER=yes in /etc/make.conf will enable QA tests to detect this)
    
    If updating a port
	portsnap fetch update
	Merge latest changes in committed port into development port

    # Created by: First-name Last-name <email>
    # $FreeBSD$
    
    Check/correct MASTER_SITES
	Use https if possible to protect download stream from hackers
	USE_GITHUB, SF, DISTVERSIONPREFIX, etc. if possible
	DISTVERSIONPREFIX=v preferred over GH_TAGNAME=v${PORTVERSION}
	No need to manually set WRKSRC if using USE_GITHUB
    
    Check use of each LOCALBASE and PREFIX
    Convert /usr/wip and ../.. to ${PORTSDIR}
    Use ${PORTNAME}, ${PORTVERSION}, etc in body wherever possible
    Check categories
    
    MAINTAINER=     email
    
    Check comment

    Add LICENSE (after COMMENT)

    Add NO_ARCH=yes before USES if the port is architecture free
	e.g. Only installs scripts
    
    Remove WITH_DEBUG if present

    Replace pre and post with <bsd.port.mk> if possible

    Check versions of all depends
	Be as generic as possible
	Use USES or USE_* variables wherever possible
	    See /usr/ports/Mk/Uses
	New LIB_DEPENDS format: libname.so
    
    OPTIONS
	All non-options macros before bsd.options.mk
	Add DOCS to OPTIONS_DEFINE if needed
	Remove PORT_OPTIONS:MDOCS checks (automatic with staging)
	Check OPTIONS_DEFINE for standards like MYSQL, etc.
    
    If installing config files in PREFIX/etc:
	suffix with .sample
	delete real config file on deinstall if identical to .sample
    
    Man pages
	Remove MANx macros from Makefile (obsolete with staging)
	Add to pkg-plist
    
    Bump PORT_REVISION if not changing VERSION
	Otherwise, remove PORT_REVISION
    
    Add PORT_EPOCH if downgrading

    Remove MAKE_JOBS_UNSAFE if possible
    
    Replace NOPORTDOCS, etc. with PORT_OPTIONS:MDOC
    
    Remove cat pkg-message if present
    
Carefully inspect pkg-plist
    pkgconfig files should be in libdata/pkgconfig
    Most configure scripts support --with-pkgconfigdir= even if not advertised

Carefully check patches
    Patching should be done at the earliest possible stage, e.g. don't
    patch in post-stage if the same effect can be achieved in post-patch

Check pkg-descr
    spell-check
    space, not tab after WWW

Make sure there's a man page

make patch makepatch

Remove any extraneous files from port framework and add a post-extract ${RM}
for any preexisting .orig files that cause makepatch to generate an extraneous
patch

Test on all available platforms.  Do the following IN ORDER:

    Add DEVELOPER=yes to /etc/make.conf to enable QA tests

    wip-reinstall-port -u -r ports-mgmt/port-dev
    port-check

    test with NOPORT* (whatever is in pkg-plist)

Test with poudriere to ensure all depends are installed by the port

Generate unified diff for updates, shar file for new ports
    (port-diff or port-shar scripts from ports-mgmt/port-dev)

Carefully inspect diff or shar

Follow porter's handbook to submit new port or update.
    https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/porters-handbook/

If maintaining source

    tag this version of source and create next one

else
    1)  Send patches through proper channels.
    
    2)  Contact author(s):

    People often assume the only supported platforms are those listed on
    the software's home page and that they should follow the (usually
    inadequate) instructions on the developer's site to install the software.
    A simple note about using a package manager and a link to the ports site
    can do a lot to raise awareness of the advantages of FreeBSD ports and
    other package managers.

    Send the following message AFTER THE PORT IS COMMITTED and then
    update FreeBSD-citing.

FYI:

[Software name] has been committed to the FreeBSD ports collection.
It might be helpful to users if you could post a message like
the following on your website:

[Software name] can be installed on FreeBSD via the FreeBSD ports
system.

To install via the binary package, simply run:

    pkg install [put package name here]

To build and install from source code, run:

    cd /usr/ports/category/[put port name here] && make install

Building from source allows installing to a different prefix and
in some cases, building with non-default options.
