Distfile
    If maintaining the source, clean up and reroll distfile

Makefile:
    Check all installed scripts for proper shebang line
	(DEVELOPER=yes in /etc/make.conf will enable QA tests to detect this)
    
    Merge latest changes in committed port into development port

    # Created by: First Last <email>
    # $FreeBSD$
    
    Check use of each LOCALBASE and PREFIX
    Convert /usr/wip and ../.. to ${PORTSDIR}
    Use ${PORTNAME}, ${PORTVERSION}, etc in body wherever possible
    Check categories
    
    Check/correct MASTER_SITES
    
    MAINTAINER=     email
    
    Check comment

    Add LICENSE (after COMMENT)
    
    Check versions of all depends
	Be as generic as possible
	Use USES or USE_* variables wherever possible
	New LIB_DEPENDS format: libname.so
    
    OPTIONS
	All non-options macros before bsd.options.mk
	Add DOCS to OPTIONS_DEFINE if needed
	Remove PORT_OPTIONS:MDOCS checks (automatic with staging)
	Check OPTIONS_DEFINE for standards like MYSQL, etc.
    
    If installing config files in PREFIX/etc:
	suffix with .sample
	delete real config file on deinstall if identical to .sample
    
    Man pages
	Remove MANx macros from Makefile (obsolete with staging)
	Add to pkg-plist
    
    Bump PORT_REVISION if not changing VERSION
	Otherwise, remove PORT_REVISION
    
    Add PORT_EPOCH if downgrading

    Remove MAKE_JOBS_UNSAFE if possible
    
    Remove NO_STAGE if possible
	Follow checklist at https://wiki.freebsd.org/ports/StageDir
    
    Replace NOPORTDOCS, etc. with PORT_OPTIONS:MDOC
    
    Replace pre.mk with options.mk, post.mk with mk
    
Carefully inspect plist

Check pkg-descr
    spell-check
    space, not tab after WWW

Make sure there's a man page

Remove any extraneous files from port framework

Test on a blank VM or tinderbox to ensure all depends are installed by the port

Test on all available platforms.  Do the following IN ORDER:

    make distclean
    portlint -A
    make deinstall
    make rmconfig
    make reinstall
    test with NOPORT* (whatever is in pkg-plist)

Generate unified diff for updates, shar file for new ports
    (diff-port or shar-port scripts)

Carefully inspect diff or shar

Follow porter's handbook to submit new port or update.
    
touch submitted; svn add submitted; svn commit

If maintaining source

    tag this version of source and create next one

else
    Contact author:
	Ask them to post that their software can be installed on FreeBSD via
	ports:
    
	pkg install name
	
	or
	
	cd /usr/ports/category/name && make install
	
	People often assume the only supported platforms are those listed on
	the software's home page.  A simple link to a ports site can do a lot
	to raise awareness of the advantages of FreeBSD ports.
    
	Send patches through proper channels.
