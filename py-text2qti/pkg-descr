text2qti converts Markdown-based plain text files into quizzes in QTI
format (version 1.2), which can be imported by Canvas and other
educational software. It supports multiple-choice, true/false,
multiple-answers, numerical, short-answer (fill-in-the-blank), essay,
and file-upload questions. It includes basic support for LaTeX math
within Markdown, and allows a limited subset of siunitx notation for
units and for numbers in scientific notation.
