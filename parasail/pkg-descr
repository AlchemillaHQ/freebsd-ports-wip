Parasail is a SIMD C (C99) library containing implementations of the
Smith-Waterman (local), Needleman-Wunsch (global), and various
semi-global pairwise sequence alignment algorithms. Here, semi-global
means insertions before the start or after the end of either the query
or target sequence are optionally not penalized.
