The PICRUSt project aims to support prediction of the unobserved character
states in a community of organisms from phylogenetic information about the
organisms in that community. The primary application is to predict gene family
abundance (e.g. the metagenome) in environmental DNA samples for which only
marker gene (e.g. 16S rRNA gene) data are available.
