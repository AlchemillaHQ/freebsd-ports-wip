OMNeT++ is a public-source, component-based, modular and
open-architecture simulation environment with strong GUI support and an
embeddable simulation kernel. Its primary application area is the
simulation of communication networks, but it has been successfully used
in other areas like the simulation of IT systems, queueing networks,
hardware architectures and business processes as well.
