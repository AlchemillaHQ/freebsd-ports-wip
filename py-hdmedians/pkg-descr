Did you know there is no unique way to mathematically extend the concept of a
median to higher dimensions?
Various definitions for a high-dimensional median exist and this Python package
provides a number of fast implementations of these definitions. Medians are
extremely useful due to their high breakdown point (up to 50% contamination)
and have a number of nice applications in machine learning, computer vision,
and high-dimensional statistics.
