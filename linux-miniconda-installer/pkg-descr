Linux Conda packages work about as well on FreeBSD as they do on CentOS, which
is the basis of FreeBSD's Linux compatibility tool set.  However, Conda and
its packages require a complete Linux environment for full functionality,
where "uname" reports "Linux" rather than "FreeBSD", etc.

Typical Conda users do not know how to configure this environment on FreeBSD.
Miniconda-installer ensures a proper environment for installing and using
Miniconda and the packages it provides.

The "miniconda-installer" script ensures that the Linux compatibility
environment is fully configured then automatically downloads and runs the
Linux Miniconda installer.

The "conda-shell" script performs some checks and launches a Linux bash shell,
which is necessary for conda and many of its packages to function properly.
