Miniconda-installer is a tool to aid FreeBSD users in installing and using
Linux Conda packages.  The miniconda-installer wrapper script ensures that
the Linux compatibility environment is fully configured then automatically
downloads and runs the Linux miniconda installer.  The conda-shell wrapper
script performs some checks and launches a Linux bash shell, which is
necessary for conda to function properly.
