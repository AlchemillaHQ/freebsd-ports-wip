MRIcro allows Windows and Linux computers view medical images. It is a 
standalone program, but includes tools to complement SPM (software that 
allows neuroimagers to analyse MRI, fMRI and PET images). MRIcro allows 
efficient viewing and exporting of brain images. In addition, it allows 
neuropsychologists to identify regions of interest (ROIs, e.g. lesions). 
MRIcro can create Analyze format headers for exporting brain images to 
other platforms.
