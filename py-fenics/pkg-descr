FEniCS is a popular open-source (LGPLv3) computing platform for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs). FEniCS enables users to quickly translate
scientific models into efficient finite element code. With the high-level Python
and C++ interfaces to FEniCS, it is easy to get started, but FEniCS offers also
powerful capabilities for more experienced programmers. FEniCS runs on a
multitude of platforms ranging from laptops to high-performance clusters.
