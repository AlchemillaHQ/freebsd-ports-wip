Open Hospital (OH) is deployed as a desktop application that can be
used in a standalone, single user mode (PORTABLE mode) or in a client /
server network configuration (CLIENT mode), where multiple clients and
users connect to the same database server. OH is developed in Java and
it is based on open-source tools and libraries; it runs on any
computer, requires low resources and is designed to work without an
internet connection. For more information check the online
