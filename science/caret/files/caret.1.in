.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.B Caret
(Computerized Anatomical Reconstruction and Editing Toolkit) 
is designed for interactively viewing, manipulating, and analyzing surface
reconstructions of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex. 

For full documentation, please consult the Help menu within caret5.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

All caret users will need the environment variable CARET5_HOME set to
%%DATADIR%%.

.nf
.na
C-shell family: 
	setenv CARET5_HOME %%DATADIR%%

Bourne-shell family:
	CARET5_HOME=%%DATADIR%%
	export CARET5_HOME
.ad
.fi

As an alternative to manual setup shown above, this port (and many other MRI
ports) include configuration scripts to automaticaly perform this setup.
Using these scripts, a single addition to your shell's startup script will
automatically configure the environment for all MRI ports that include
a configuration script.

To utilize these scripts in C-shell compatible shells, add the following
to your .cshrc:

.nf
.na
foreach script (%%PREFIX%%/etc/mri/*.cshrc)
    source ${script}
end

For Bourne-shell compatibles, add the following to your .profile:

for script in %%PREFIX%%/etc/mri/*.profile; do
    . ${script}
done
.ad
.fi


.SH INSTALLATION

Caret is an OpenGL application, and requires the nVIDIA driver
(x11/nvidia-driver) or DRI (graphics/dri) for 3D graphics to function.

You must add /usr/local/lib/qt4/plugins/imageformats/ to your library path
so that caret5 will find libqgif.so.  For this session, run the following
as root:

.nf
.na
	ldconfig -m /usr/local/lib/qt4/plugins/imageformats

To make ldconfig scan this directory at boot time, add

	/usr/local/lib/qt4/plugins/imageformats

to

	/etc/ld-elf.so.conf
.ad
.fi
