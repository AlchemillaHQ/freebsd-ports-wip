.SH "DESCRIPTION"

ITK is an open-source software system to support the Visible Human
Project. Currently under active development, ITK employs leading-edge
segmentation and registration algorithms in two, three, and more
dimensions. 

The Insight Toolkit was developed by six principal organizations, three
commercial (Kitware, GE Corporate R&D, and Insightful) and three academic
(UNC Chapel Hill, University of Utah, and University of Pennsylvania).
Additional team members include Harvard Brigham & Women's Hospital,
University of Pittsburgh, and Columbia University. The funding for the
project is from the National Library of Medicine at the National
Institutes of Health. NLM in turn was supported by member institutions of
NIH (see sponsors). 
 
The goals for the project include the following: 

.nf
