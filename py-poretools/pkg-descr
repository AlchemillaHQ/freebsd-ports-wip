The MinION (TM) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) is the first nanopore
sequencer to be commercialised and is now available to early-access users. The
MinION (TM) is a USB-connected, portable nanopore sequencer which permits
real-time analysis of streaming event data. Currently, the research community
lacks a standardized toolkit for the analysis of nanopore datasets.

We have therefore develped poretools, a flexible toolkit for exploring datasets
generated by nanopore sequencing devices from MinION for the purposes of
quality control and downstream analysis. Poretools operates directly on the
native FAST5 (a variant of the HDF5 standard) file format produced by ONT and
provides a wealth of format conversion utilities and data exploration and
visualization tools.
