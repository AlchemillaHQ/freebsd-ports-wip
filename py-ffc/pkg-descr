FFC is a compiler for finite element variational forms. From a high-level
description of the form, it generates efficient low-level C++ code that can be
used to assemble the corresponding discrete operator (tensor). In particular, a
bilinear form may be assembled into a matrix and a linear form may be assembled
into a vector. FFC may be used either from the command line (by invoking the ffc
command) or as a Python module (import ffc).
