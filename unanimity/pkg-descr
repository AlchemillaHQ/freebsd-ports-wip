Unanimity is a C++ library and applications to generate and process accurate
consensus sequences from Pacific Biosciences sequence data.

CCS (circular consensus calling) takes multiple reads of the same SMRTbell
sequence and combines them, employing a statistical model, to produce one high
quality consensus sequence.
