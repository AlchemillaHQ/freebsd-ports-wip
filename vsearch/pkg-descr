The aim of this project is to create an alternative to the USEARCH tool
developed by Robert C. Edgar (2010). The new tool should:

    o have open source code with an appropriate open source license
    o be free of charge, gratis
    o have a 64-bit design that handles very large databases and much more
      than 4GB of memory
    o be as accurate as or more accurate than usearch
    o be as fast as or faster than usearch
