The SRA Toolkit and SDK from NCBI is a collection of tools and libraries for
using data in the INSDC Sequence Read Archives.

Native FreeBSD ports have been built, but the build system is complex and
esoteric, so this port based on the Linux binaries is maintained for quick
access to the latest versions.
