The SRA Toolkit and SDK from NCBI is a collection of tools and libraries for
using data in the INSDC Sequence Read Archives.

Native FreeBSD ports have been built and are preferable, but the build system
is complex and esoteric, so this port based on the developers' Linux binaries
is maintained for quick access to the latest versions.
