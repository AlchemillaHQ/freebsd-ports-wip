Sumaclust aims to cluster sequences in a way that is fast and exact at the
same time. This tool has been developed to be adapted to the type of data
generated by DNA metabarcoding, i.e. entirely sequenced, short markers.
Sumaclust clusters sequences using the same clustering algorithm as UCLUST and
CD-HIT. This algorithm is mainly useful to detect the 'erroneous' sequences
created during amplification and sequencing protocols, deriving from 'true'
sequences.
