SeqLib is a C++ library for querying BAM/SAM/CRAM files, performing
BWA-MEM operations in memory, and performing sequence assembly. Core
operations in SeqLib are peformed by HTSlib, BWA-MEM (Apache2 branch)
and FermiKit.
There are, not surprisingly, multiple projects named SeqLib around.
This is the implementation from COMBINE-lab, a stripped-down fork of
the walaj project.
