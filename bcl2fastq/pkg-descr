Illumina sequencing instruments generate per-cycle BCL basecall files as
primary sequencing output, but many downstream analysis applications use
per-read FASTQ files as input. bcl2fastq combines these per-cycle BCL files
from a run and translates them into FASTQ files. bcl2fastq can begin bcl
conversion as soon as the first read has been completely sequenced.
