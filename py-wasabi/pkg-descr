Over the years, I've written countless implementations of coloring and
formatting utilities to output messages in our libraries like spaCy, Thinc and
Prodigy. While there are many other great open-source options, I've always
ended up wanting something slightly different or slightly custom.
This package is still a work in progress and aims to bundle those utilities in
a standardised way so they can be shared across our other projects. It's super
lightweight, has zero dependencies and works across Python 2 and 3.
