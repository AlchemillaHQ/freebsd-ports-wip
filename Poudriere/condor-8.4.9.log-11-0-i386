  =========== BACKUP YOUR DATA! =============
  As always, backup your data before
  upgrading. If the upgrade leads to a higher
  minor revision (e.g. 8.3.x -> 8.4), a dump
  and restore of all databases is
  required. This is *NOT* done by the port!

  Press ctrl-C *now* if you need to pg_dump.

Message from perl5-5.20.3_15:
The /usr/bin/perl symlink has been removed starting with Perl 5.20.
For shebangs, you should either use:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

or

#!/usr/bin/env perl

The first one will only work if you have a /usr/local/bin/perl,
the second will work as long as perl is in PATH.
Message from postgresql93-client-9.3.14_1:
The PostgreSQL port has a collection of "side orders":

postgresql-docs
  For all of the html documentation

p5-Pg
  A perl5 API for client access to PostgreSQL databases.

postgresql-tcltk
  If you want tcl/tk client support.

postgresql-jdbc
  For Java JDBC support.

postgresql-odbc
  For client access from unix applications using ODBC as access
  method. Not needed to access unix PostgreSQL servers from Win32
  using ODBC. See below.

ruby-postgres, py-PyGreSQL
  For client access to PostgreSQL databases using the ruby & python
  languages.

postgresql-plperl, postgresql-pltcl & postgresql-plruby
  For using perl5, tcl & ruby as procedural languages.

postgresql-contrib
  Lots of contributed utilities, postgresql functions and
  datatypes. There you find pg_standby, pgcrypto and many other cool
  things.

etc...
Message from postgresql93-server-9.3.14_1:
For procedural languages and postgresql functions, please note that
you might have to update them when updating the server.

If you have many tables and many clients running, consider raising
kern.maxfiles using sysctl(8), or reconfigure your kernel
appropriately.

The port is set up to use autovacuum for new databases, but you might
also want to vacuum and perhaps backup your database regularly. There
is a periodic script, /usr/local/etc/periodic/daily/502.pgsql, that
you may find useful. You can use it to backup and perfom vacuum on all
databases nightly. Per default, it perfoms `vacuum analyze'. See the
script for instructions. For autovacuum settings, please review
~pgsql/data/postgresql.conf.

If you plan to access your PostgreSQL server using ODBC, please
consider running the SQL script /usr/local/share/postgresql/odbc.sql
to get the functions required for ODBC compliance.

Please note that if you use the rc script,
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/postgresql, to initialize the database, unicode
(UTF-8) will be used to store character data by default.  Set
postgresql_initdb_flags or use login.conf settings described below to
alter this behaviour. See the start rc script for more info.

To set limits, environment stuff like locale and collation and other
things, you can set up a class in /etc/login.conf before initializing
the database. Add something similar to this to /etc/login.conf:
---
postgres:\
	:lang=en_US.UTF-8:\
	:setenv=LC_COLLATE=C:\
	:tc=default:
---
and run `cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf'.
Then add 'postgresql_class="postgres"' to /etc/rc.conf.

======================================================================

To initialize the database, run

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/postgresql initdb

You can then start PostgreSQL by running:

  /usr/local/etc/rc.d/postgresql start

For postmaster settings, see ~pgsql/data/postgresql.conf

NB. FreeBSD's PostgreSQL port logs to syslog by default
    See ~pgsql/data/postgresql.conf for more info

======================================================================

To run PostgreSQL at startup, add
'postgresql_enable="YES"' to /etc/rc.conf

Unless this is the central manager host, you will need to at least change
CONDOR_HOST.  Also ensure that DAEMON_LIST and ALLOW_* are appropriate for
this host.

To start the condor daemons, add 'condor_enable="YES"' to

	/etc/rc.conf

and run

	service condor start
