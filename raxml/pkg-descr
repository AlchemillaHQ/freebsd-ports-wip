RAxML (Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood) is a program for sequential
and parallel Maximum Likelihood based inference of large phylogenetic trees. It
can also be used for post- analyses of sets of phylogenetic trees, analyses of
alignments and, evolutionary placement of short reads. It has originally been
derived from fastDNAml which in turn was derived from Joe Felsentein's dnaml
which is part of the PHYLIP package.
