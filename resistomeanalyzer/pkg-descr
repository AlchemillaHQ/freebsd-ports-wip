Resistome Analyzer is a simple tool for analyzing the resistome of large
metagenomic dataets. This program takes in as input a SAM formatted alignment
file, a FASTA formatted reference database, and a CSV formatted annotation
database. The alignment file is treated as the sample resistome. This is done by
counting each alignment for each target gene found in the alignment file.
