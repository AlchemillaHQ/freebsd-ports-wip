Message from qtchooser-39:

qtchooser is a wrapper that allows selecting whether Qt4 or Qt5 binaries for
qmake, moc and other tools will be run when invoking the binaries in $PATH.

By default, the Qt5 versions are run. It is possible to change the behavior by
setting the QT_SELECT environment variable to "qt4". See qtchooser(1) for more
information.

Message from perl5-5.26.2:

The /usr/bin/perl symlink has been removed starting with Perl 5.20.
For shebangs, you should either use:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl

or

#!/usr/bin/env perl

The first one will only work if you have a /usr/local/bin/perl,
the second will work as long as perl is in PATH.
Message from python27-2.7.14_1:

===========================================================================

Note that some standard Python modules are provided as separate ports
as they require additional dependencies. They are available as:

bsddb           databases/py-bsddb
gdbm            databases/py-gdbm
sqlite3         databases/py-sqlite3
tkinter         x11-toolkits/py-tkinter

Message from qt4-corelib-4.8.7_12:

======================================================================

Qt 4 can be built with optional support for:
 - Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) (enabled by default)
 - Network Audio System (NAS)
 - Qt style that renders using GTK (QGTKSTYLE)

In order to enable them, you have to add
	QT4_OPTIONS=	CUPS NAS QGTKSTYLE
to your /etc/make.conf and compile devel/qt4-corelib and
x11-toolkits/qt4-gui ports.

Attention! Whenever you change the QT4_OPTIONS both
devel/qt4-corelib and x11-toolkits/qt4-gui ports must be rebuilt!

Message from trousers-0.3.14_2:

To run tcsd automatically, add the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

tcsd_enable="YES"

You might want to edit /usr/local/etc/tcsd.conf to reflect your setup.

If you want to use tcsd with software TPM emulator, use the following
configuration in /etc/rc.conf:

tcsd_enable="YES"
tcsd_mode="emulator"
tpmd_enable="YES"

To use TPM, add your_account to '_tss' group like following:

# pw groupmod _tss -m your_account
Message from freetype2-2.9_1:

The 2.7.x series now uses the new subpixel hinting mode (V40 port's option) as
the default, emulating a modern version of ClearType. This change inevitably
leads to different rendering results, and you might change port's options to
adapt it to your taste (or use the new "FREETYPE_PROPERTIES" environment
variable).

The environment variable "FREETYPE_PROPERTIES" can be used to control the
driver properties. Example:

FREETYPE_PROPERTIES=truetype:interpreter-version=35 \
	cff:no-stem-darkening=1 \
	autofitter:warping=1

This allows to select, say, the subpixel hinting mode at runtime for a given
application.

The controllable properties are listed in the section "Controlling FreeType
Modules" in the reference's table of contents
(/usr/local/share/doc/freetype2/reference/ft2-toc.html, if documentation was installed).
Message from dejavu-2.37:

Make sure that the freetype module is loaded.  If it is not, add the following
line to the "Modules" section of your X Windows configuration file:

	Load "freetype"

Add the following line to the "Files" section of X Windows configuration file:

	FontPath "/usr/local/share/fonts/dejavu/"

Note: your X Windows configuration file is typically /etc/X11/XF86Config
if you are using XFree86, and /etc/X11/xorg.conf if you are using X.Org.
