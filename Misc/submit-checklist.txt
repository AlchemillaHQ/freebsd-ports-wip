Distfile
--------
    If maintaining the source, clean up and reroll distfile

Makefile
--------
    PORTNAME should match the upstream dist, including case
	pkg is case-insensitive
	Ports that install only one binary can use the binary name

    Replace PORTVERSION with DISTVERSION wherever possible
	* Only when changing version - breaks svn annotate / git blame
	DISTVERSION must match upstream version
	PORTVERSION is derived from DISTVERSION
	Use PORTVERSION directly if DISTVERSION is incompatible with
	    FreeBSD version rules
	See porter's handbook "Configuring the Makefile" for details

    Bump PORT_REVISION if not changing VERSION
	Otherwise, remove PORT_REVISION
    
    Add PORT_EPOCH if downgrading

    Check categories
	Add java, perl5, python, etc. for ports that use them

    Tab after every =
    
    Use = instead of += wherever possible
	Use += only for vars commonly set in make.conf, like CFLAGS.
    
    If updating a port
	portsnap fetch update
	Merge latest changes in committed port into development port

    PKGNAMEPREFIX
	p5-, ${PYTHON_PKGNAMEPREFIX}, etc.
    
    Check/correct MASTER_SITES
	Use https if possible to protect download stream from hackers
	USE_GITHUB, SF, DISTVERSIONPREFIX, etc. if possible
	DISTVERSIONPREFIX=v preferred over GH_TAGNAME=v${DISTVERSION}
	No need to manually set WRKSRC if using USE_GITHUB
	Remove MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR if present (deprecated)

    GITHUB
	See USE_GITHUB in guide for versioning between releases, etc.
    
    Check use of each LOCALBASE and PREFIX
    Remove references to wip category
    Use ${PORTNAME}, ${DISTVERSION}, etc in body wherever possible
    
    MAINTAINER=     email
    
    Check comment

    Add LICENSE (after COMMENT)
	Add LICENSE_FILE if included in dist

    Add NO_ARCH=yes if the port is architecture free
	e.g. Only installs scripts or Java byte code
    
    Remove WITH_DEBUG if present

    Replace pre and post with <bsd.port.mk> if possible

    Check versions of all depends
	Be as generic as possible

    Check order of blocks:
	https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/porting-order.html

    Use USES or USE_* variables wherever possible
	USES before USE_*
	    USES=localbase = CFLAGS+=-I${LOCALBASE}/include, etc.
	    See /usr/ports/Mk/Uses
	USE_TEX instead of tex-* depends
	pathfix for pkgconfig lib/libdata
	USE_XORG= instead of LIB_DEPENDS where possible

    Python
	https://wiki.freebsd.org/Python/PortsPolicy
	Use autoplist unless there's a good reason not to
	If including a plist, USE_PYTHON+=py3kplist
	    %%PYTHON_PYOEXTENSION%%->pyo? (antoine)
	USE_PYTHON=concurrent if multiple flavors install the same files
	Ports that depend on a python module should use USES=python:env or :run
	${PYNUMPY} for numpy dep.  Check python.mk for other goodies
	Deps should end in @${PY_FLAVOR}
    
    BROKEN_${OPSYS}_${REL}_${ARCH}
    
    OPTIONS
        options.mk should not be needed anymore
	All non-options macros before bsd.options.mk
	Add DOCS and EXAMPLES to OPTIONS_DEFINE if needed
	    If installing to PORTDOCS or PORTEXAMPLES:
		OPTIONS_DEFINE= DOCS EXAMPLES
		PORTDOCS= *
	Remove PORT_OPTIONS:MDOCS checks (automatic with staging)
	Check OPTIONS_DEFINE for standards like MYSQL, etc.
    
    If installing config files (usually .conf):
	suffix with .sample
	    may need to hack install
	plist entry: @sample path/file.conf.sample
	This will automatically install/deinstall .conf file if not different
	from sample
    
    Remove MAKE_JOBS_UNSAFE if possible
    
    WRKSRC_SUBDIR instead of WRKSRC if possible

    Check need for USES vars like pkgconfig, localbase, gettext,
	desktop-file-utils (installs a .desktop file)
	DEVELOPER=yes will help with this during stage-qa

    CMAKE_ARGS format VAR:BOOL=ON, not VAR=1
	CMAKE_ON and CMAKE_OFF where possible

    Use CFLAGS_i386, CFLAGS_amd64, etc.
    
    Use COPYTREE_* instead of ${CP} -r
	Combine dirs going to the same destination:
	    cd ${WRKSRC} && COPYTREE_SHARE "A B C" ${STAGEDIR}...
    
    Use @ to silence most commands, except commands that affect installed files
    
    Carefully check REINPLACE_CMDS and patches
	Patching should be done at the earliest possible stage, e.g. don't
	patch in post-stage if the same effect can be achieved in post-patch

    $() preferred over ``


Testing
-------
    Check all installed scripts for proper shebang line
	(DEVELOPER=yes in /etc/make.conf will enable QA tests to detect this)
	USES=shebangfix
	SHEBANG_FILES=path ...


pkg-plist
---------
    pkgconfig files should be in libdata/pkgconfig
	configure may support --with-pkgconfigdir= even if not advertised
    Use EXAMPLESDIR, DOCSDIR, DATADIR where possible
    Executables called by bin/* but not meant for users go in libexec
    Optional scripts for users go in DATADIR or EXAMPLESDIR at your discretion
    Perl modules (*.pm) ${PREFIX}/${SITE_PERL_REL}
    Java .jar files in ${JAVAJARDIR}


pkg-descr
---------
    Find a good description more than once sentence long
    spell-check
    space, not tab after WWW
    fmt -w 79

Remove any extraneous files from port framework and add a post-extract ${RM}
for any preexisting .orig files that cause makepatch to generate an extraneous
patch

Test on all available platforms.  Do the following IN ORDER:

    Add DEVELOPER=yes to /etc/make.conf to enable QA tests

    wip-reinstall-port -u -r ports-mgmt/port-dev
    port-check

    test with NOPORT* (whatever is in pkg-plist)

    If USES=ssl, test with each of the following in /etc/make.conf:
	DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= ssl=libressl
	DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= ssl=openssl
	DEFAULT_VERSIONS+= base

	See /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.default-versions.mk

Test with poudriere to ensure all depends are installed by the port
    If you've installed Poudriere with port-poudriere-setup:
	wip-poudriere-test category/portname all
    Python flavors are not tested by default:
	Also run testport cat/port@py36 or use poudriere bulk -t

Generate unified diff for updates, shar file for new ports
    (port-diff or port-shar scripts from ports-mgmt/port-dev)

Carefully inspect diff or shar

Follow porter's handbook to submit new port or update.

After commit
------------
If maintaining source

    tag this version of source and create next one

    update wip ports if present

else
    1)  Send patches through proper channels.
    
    2)  Contact author(s):

    People often assume the only supported platforms are those listed on
    the software's home page and that they should follow the (usually
    inadequate) instructions on the developer's site to install the software.
    A simple note about using a package manager and a link to the ports site
    can do a lot to raise awareness of the advantages of FreeBSD ports and
    other package managers.

    Send the following message AFTER THE PORT IS COMMITTED and then
    update FreeBSD-citing.
	
============================================================================

FYI:

[Software name] has been committed to the FreeBSD ports collection.
It might be helpful to users if you could post a message like
the following on your website:

Regards,

    [Your name]

[Software name] can be installed on FreeBSD via the FreeBSD ports
system.

To install via the binary package, simply run:

    pkg install [put package name here]

To build and install from source code, run:

    cd /usr/ports/category/[put port name here] && make install

Building from source allows installing to a different prefix and
in some cases, building with non-default options.

For more information, visit https://www.freebsd.org/ports/index.html.

Switch dependencies in other wip ports from /usr/wip to ${PORTSDIR}
