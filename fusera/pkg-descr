fusera (FUSE for SRA) is a FUSE implementation for the cloud extension to the
NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA). SRA accepts data from all kinds of sequencing
projects including studies that involve human subjects or their metagenomes,
which may contain human sequences. Access to this data is controlled via dbGaP
(the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes). To gain access to data from such a
controlled access study, users would submit a Data Access Request (DAR) for
their research project. Users with approved DARs can access the study's
phenotype and genotype data via dbGaP, and the sequence data via the SRA.
Traditionally, the SRA was a repository that facilitated download of data to
the user's compute environment. As part of the Sequence Data Delivery Pilot
(SDDP), the SRA has been extended to provide access to cloud-hosted data
through its Data Locator web-services API using signedURL. fusera presents
selected SRA data referenced with an SRA accession number to authorized users
as a read-only file system, enabling users and tools to access the data through
a file system interface.
