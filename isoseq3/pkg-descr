IsoSeq3 contains the newest tools to identify transcripts in PacBio
single-molecule sequencing data. Starting in SMRT Link v6.0.0, those tools
power the IsoSeq3 GUI-based analysis application. A composable workflow of
existing tools and algorithms, combined with a new clustering technique, allows
to process the ever-increasing yield of PacBio machines with similar
performance to IsoSeq1 and IsoSeq2.
