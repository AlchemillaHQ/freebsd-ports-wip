This software performs machine learning based on computed features of genomic
regions using a set of supervised learning methods, and picks the best method
according to an unbiased procedure. It does not generate the features, as the
generation process involves third-party software for tasks such as sequence
alignment and RNA structure prediction. The file format of datasets and a
script for running the program can be found in the file readme.txt inside the
packages.
