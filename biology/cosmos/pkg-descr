COSMOS is a Python library for workflow management that allows formal
description of pipelines and partitioning of jobs. In addition, it includes a
user-interface for tracking the progress of jobs, abstraction of the queuing
system and fine-grained control over the workflow. Workflows can be created on
traditional computing clusters as well as cloud-based services.
