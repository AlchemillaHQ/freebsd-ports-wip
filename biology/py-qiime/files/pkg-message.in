You must have usearch61 in your PATH in order to use certain features of qiime.

The 32-bit version can be installed using biology/usearch-6.1.

Visit the link below for details:

It may be possible to use biology/vsearch as a replacement by linking or
copying %%LOCALBASE%%/bin/vsearch to usearch61, but this is not tested or
supported.
