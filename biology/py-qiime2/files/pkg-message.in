Each user must have usearch 5.2.236 in their PATH as "usearch" and
usearch 6.1 as "usearch61" in order to use certain features of qiime.

Each user must download and install usearch individually, as it uses
a closed-source, non-transferrable license.

Visit the link below for details:

It may be possible to use biology/vsearch as a replacement using a wrapper
to discard incompatible command-line flags.
