This is a collection of work-in-progress FreeBSD ports.  

If you would like to contribute to the collection:

o   Contact the owner of the repository and ask to be added as a Github
    collaborator, so you can then commit changes made do your local working
    copy.

    Collaborators need to follow one simple rule:

        Do not modify someone else's port without their consent.

    There are no quality or security requirements for ports of your own.
    Ports in this collection are works-in-progress and may be in any stage
    of development from completely non-functional to ready-to-commit.

    You can use either git or subversion to manage your working copy.  Note
    that ports-mgmt/wip-tools currently relies on subversion.

    Note: Github does not support subversion "mv" or "cp" commands.
          Use "cp -R", "svn add", and "svn rm" instead.

o   ADOPT-A-PORT:

    If there is an existing port that you are interested it, PLEASE PLEASE
    PLEASE inquire about adopting it by contacting the maintainer (see the
    port Makefile for contact info).  There are many ports here and they will
    move beyond WIP faster if more people sign up as maintainers.

To install any of these ports:

1)  Check out a copy to /usr/wip.

    svn co https://outpaddling@github.com/outpaddling/freebsd-ports-wip/trunk \
	/usr/wip

    or

    git clone https://outpaddling@github.com/outpaddling/freebsd-ports-wip
    mv freebsd-ports-wip /usr/wip

2)  Then install the ports of interest:

    cd /usr/wip/category/port && make deinstall clean install

---

Note that there are committed, quality-controlled versions of many of these
ports available.  If you want the latest stable version, use the usual
FreeBSD ports installation methods:

    pkg install package-name

or

    cd /usr/ports/category/port && make deinstall clean install
