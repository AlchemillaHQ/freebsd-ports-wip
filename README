This is a collection of work-in-progress FreeBSD ports.  

If you would like to contribute to the collection:

o   Contact the owner of the repository and ask to be added as a Github
    collaborator.

o   ADOPT-A-PORT:

    If there is an existing port that you are interested it, PLEASE PLEASE
    PLEASE inquire about adopting it by contacting the maintainer (see the
    port Makefile for contact info).  There are many ports here and they will
    move beyond WIP faster if more people sign up as maintainers.

To install any of these ports:

1)  Check out a copy to /usr/wip.

    svn co https://outpaddling@github.com/outpaddling/freebsd-ports-wip/trunk \
	/usr/wip

    or

    git clone https://outpaddling@github.com/outpaddling/freebsd-ports-wip
    mv freebsd-ports-wip /usr/wip

2)  Then install the ports of interest:

    cd /usr/wip/category/port && make deinstall clean install

---

Note that there are committed, quality-controlled versions of many of these
ports available.  If you want the latest stable version, use the usual
FreeBSD ports installation methods:

    pkg install package-name

or

    cd /usr/ports/category/port && make deinstall clean install
