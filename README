This is a collection of work-in-progress FreeBSD ports.

To install ports from this collection:

1)  Download and run the freebsd-wip-checkout script from the repository
    above.

    * Before running any script downloaded from the Internet, carefully
      inspect it for signs of tampering.  This is especially critical before
      running a script as root.

2)  Now you can install any port using

	cd /usr/ports/wip/portname
	make install

    You can reinstall a single port using

	wip-reinstall-port portname

    If you are a ports developer and have a poudriere installation, you can
    test the port by running

	wip-poudriere-test category/portname jail [jail ...] | all | pattern

3)  Run wip-update frequently to retreive the latest commits.

---

Note that there are committed, quality-controlled versions of many of these
ports available.  If you want the latest stable version, use the usual
FreeBSD ports installation methods:

    pkg install package-name

or

    cd /usr/ports/category/port && make deinstall clean install

If you would like to contribute to the collection:

o   Contact the owner of the repository and ask to be added as a Github
    collaborator, so you can commit changes made to your local working
    copy.

    Collaborators need to follow one simple rule:

	Do not modify someone else's files without their consent.

    There are no quality or security requirements for ports of your own.
    Ports in this collection are works-in-progress and may be in any stage
    of development from completely non-functional to ready-to-commit.

    You can use either git or subversion to manage your working copy.

    Note: Github does not support subversion "mv" or "cp" commands.
	  Use "cp -R", "svn add", and "svn rm" instead.

o   Adopt an existing port:

    If there is an existing port that you are interested it, PLEASE PLEASE
    PLEASE inquire about adopting it by contacting the maintainer (see the
    port Makefile for contact info).  There are many ports here and they will
    move beyond WIP faster if more people sign up as maintainers.
