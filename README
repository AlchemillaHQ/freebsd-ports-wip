This is a collection of work-in-progress FreeBSD ports.  To use these
ports:

1)  Check out a copy to /usr/wip.

2)  Then install the ports of interest:

    cd /usr/wip/category/port && make deinstall clean install

If you would like to contribute, contact the owner of the repository and
ask to be added as a collaborator.

Note that there are committed, quality-controlled versions of many of these
ports available.  If you want the latest stable version, use the usual
FreeBSD ports installation methods:

    pkg install package-name

or

    cd /usr/ports/category/port && make deinstall clean install
