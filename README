                           **** IMPORTANT ****

Due to changes in the FreeBSD ports system and the need to support
arbitrary values of /usr/ports, the structure of freebsd-wip is changing.

Rather than multiple categories under /usr/wip, all WIP ports will be
under /usr/ports/wip from here on.

This makes it possible to have multiple ports trees, each with their own
wip category and allows freebsd-wip to play by the new rules of the
ports system regarding dependencies among other things.

The old wip-update command will fail as a result of this change.

There are two possible solutions:

1)  Rename your old wip directory and check out a new one under $PORTSDIR
    (normally /usr/ports)

    cd /usr/ports/wip/wip-tools && make install

2)  Add "wip" to VALID_CATEGORIES in /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.ports.mk between
    "wayland" and "www".

    cd /usr/wip/wip-tools && make deinstall distclean reinstall

    Run wip-update again.  This should move /usr/wip to /usr/ports/wip and
    properly update the configuration.

This is a collection of work-in-progress FreeBSD ports.

To install ports from this collection:

1)  Check out a copy to /usr/ports/wip.

    svn co https://github.com/outpaddling/freebsd-ports-wip/trunk \
	/usr/ports/wip

    or

    git clone https://github.com/outpaddling/freebsd-ports-wip \
	/usr/ports/wip
    
2)  Then install the ports of interest, starting with wip-tools:

    cd /usr/ports/wip/wip-tools
    make install

3)  After installing wip-tools:

    You can update the wip collection by simply running

	wip-update

    You can reinstall a single port using

	wip-reinstall-port portname

    If you are a ports developer and have a poudriere installation, you can
    test the port by running

	wip-poudriere-test category/portname jail [jail ...] | all | pattern

---

Note that there are committed, quality-controlled versions of many of these
ports available.  If you want the latest stable version, use the usual
FreeBSD ports installation methods:

    pkg install package-name

or

    cd /usr/ports/category/port && make deinstall clean install

If you would like to contribute to the collection:

o   Contact the owner of the repository and ask to be added as a Github
    collaborator, so you can commit changes made to your local working
    copy.

    Collaborators need to follow one simple rule:

	Do not modify someone else's files without their consent.

    There are no quality or security requirements for ports of your own.
    Ports in this collection are works-in-progress and may be in any stage
    of development from completely non-functional to ready-to-commit.

    You can use either git or subversion to manage your working copy.

    Note: Github does not support subversion "mv" or "cp" commands.
	  Use "cp -R", "svn add", and "svn rm" instead.

    Check out the repository using your Github login:
    
    svn co https://username@github.com/outpaddling/freebsd-ports-wip/trunk \
	/usr/wip

    or

    git clone https://username@github.com/outpaddling/freebsd-ports-wip \
	/usr/wip

o   Adopt an existing port:

    If there is an existing port that you are interested it, PLEASE PLEASE
    PLEASE inquire about adopting it by contacting the maintainer (see the
    port Makefile for contact info).  There are many ports here and they will
    move beyond WIP faster if more people sign up as maintainers.
