FreeSurfer is FREE, but you must register and obtain
a license key to enable the software.  Please go to
http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu to register, and place
the license file in:

%%PREFIX%%/.license

===========

Linux FreeSurfer requires Linux OpenGL libraries.  It is not practical for
this port to install these libraries as a dependency, since they may be 
installed by a number of different sources, including the linux_dri port and
the nvidia-driver port.  Please install them manually from whichever source
you prefer.

===========

The environment variable FREESURFER_HOME must be set to

%%PREFIX%%/freesurfer

for each user.  Other environment setup
is done by the FreeSurfer environment setup scripts
which should be run from csh-compatible shells as follows:

    source %%PREFIX%%/FreeSurferEnv.csh
    
or from sh-compatible shells as follows:

    . %%PREFIX%%/FreeSurferEnv.sh

WARNING: These scripts alter LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which may prevent other
programs from running properly.
