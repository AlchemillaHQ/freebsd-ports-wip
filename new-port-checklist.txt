1)  Edit ~/.porttools
    
    EMAIL="your-email-address"
    FULLNAME="Your full name"

2)  cd /usr/wip/category

3)  port create portname

    -   Portname preferably contains only lower-case letters.
	Use DISTNAME in the Makefile if the distfiles have caps or
	other characters.

4)  cd portname

5)  Edit Makefile

    PORTVERSION should be of the form major.minor.revision or similar.
    
    -   This allows the ports system to compare versions in DEPENDS lines.
    -   If upstream version doesn't conform, use something like YYYY.MM.DD
	and use DISTNAME to describe the distfile name, e.g.
	
	PORTNAME=       slclust
	PORTVERSION=    2010.02.02
	DISTNAME=       ${PORTNAME}_02022010
    
    CATEGORIES should include the primary category and any major scripting
    languages used.
    
	CATEGORIES=     biology java
	CATEGORIES=     biology perl5
	CATEGORIES=     math python
    
    Determine correct MASTER_SITES
    
    -   Use USE_GITHUB, GH_ACCOUNT, GH_TAGNAME, etc. if possible
    -   Use DISTVERSIONPREFIX if possible (preferred over GH_TAGNAME
	when using USE_GITHUB)
    -   Sourceforge hint: Download from a web browser and examine the
	"direct link" to determine proper MASTER_SITES syntax.

    COMMENT should be an abbreviated version of pkg-descr limited to
    less than 1 line. Begins with a capital and no '.' at the end.
    
    Set LICENSE= below COMMENT= and a blank line.
    
    -   Look for the license info on the project website or look for
	a file such as LICENSE, COPYING, or README in the source tree
	after running "make makesum" and "make extract".

6)  Edit pkg-descr

    -   Copy, paste, and edit the summary description from the project
	website and add the website URL next to WWW.

7)  make makesum

8)  make extract

9)  Refer to the Porter's Handbook for more info.
