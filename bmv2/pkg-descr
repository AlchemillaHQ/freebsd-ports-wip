This is the second version of the reference P4 software switch,
nicknamed bmv2 (for behavioral model version 2). The software switch is
written in C++11. It takes as input a JSON file generated from your P4
program by a P4 compiler and interprets it to implement the
packet-processing behavior specified by that P4 program.
