====================================================================
If you did not allow the Matlab installer to create symbolic links 
to the Matlab binaries, users will need %%PREFIX%%/matlab/bin 
in their PATH to run matlab.

If you want to run matlab without the graphical desktop, you will need
a terminfo database installed in

	/compat/linux/usr/share/terminfo
