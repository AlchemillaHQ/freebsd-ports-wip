====================================================================

To install Matlab (r), have your license.dat file, license key,
and installation media ready, and run the following as root:

	matlab-installer

If you do not allow the Matlab installer to create symbolic links 
to the Matlab binaries, users will need

	%%PREFIX%%/matlab/bin 

in their PATH in order to run matlab from the shell prompt.

To use Unix shell commands, the built-in HTML help files, and MEX,
add something like the following to your .cshrc or other startup scripts,
so that MEX will use then Linux compilers:

# Matlab sets the ARCH environment variable.  We can use this to detect
# when a shell process was spawned by Matlab and customize the environment
# accoredingly.
if ( "$ARCH" == "glnx86" ) then
    # Make sure mex uses Linux gcc, g++, gfortran
    set path = (/compat/linux/bin /compat/linux/usr/bin $path)
    
    # Make sure FreeBSD firefox finds correct libstdc++, etc.
    setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
endif

If you do not have /dev/ptmx, run

    kldload pty

and add the following to /boot/loader.conf:

    pty_load="YES"
