The default Kodi build, and hence the binary package, does not include
libdvdcss, which cannot be packaged for legal reasons.

If you want to enable playing encrypted DVDs, you must build from source:

cd /usr/ports/multimedia/kodi
make config

[ In the configuration menu, enable the libdvdcss option ]

make deinstall reinstall
