A set of restricted permutation designs for freely exchangeable, line transects
(time series), and spatial grid designs plus permutation of blocks (groups of
samples) is provided. 'permute' also allows split-plot designs, in which the
whole-plots or split-plots or both can be freely-exchangeable or one of the
restricted designs. The 'permute' package is modelled after the permutation
schemes of 'Canoco 3.1' (and later) by Cajo ter Braak.
