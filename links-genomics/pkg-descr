LINKS is a genomics application for scaffolding genome assemblies with long
reads, such as those produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies Ltd. It can be
used to scaffold high-quality draft genome assemblies with any long sequences
(eg. ONT reads, PacBio reads, another draft genomes, etc) It is used to
scaffold contig pairs linked by ARCS/ARKS.
