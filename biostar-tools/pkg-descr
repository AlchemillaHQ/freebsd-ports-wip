Biostar-Tools is a metaport for installing all the tools necessary to work
through the Biostar Handbook.  The handbook instructs the user to install these
tools mostly via bioconda, which has little quality control and requires the
user to activate the bioconda environment each time they want to use the tools.
This meta-package installs the tools with one simple command and to the
default PATH so they just work without any special environment.
