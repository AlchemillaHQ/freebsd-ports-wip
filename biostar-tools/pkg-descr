Biostar-Tools is a metaport for installing all the tools necessary to work
through the Biostar Handbook.  The handbook instructs the user to install these
tools mostly via bioconda, which then requires the user to activate the
bioconda environment each time they want to use the tools.  This meta-package
installs all of the tools except emboss to the default PATH so they just work
without any special environment.  Emboss commands are installed to
/usr/local/emboss/bin due to conflicts with other packages.
