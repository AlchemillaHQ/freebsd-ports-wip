FYI, it might be nice to add the following to your download page:

    http://put-developer-site-here

FreeBSD Users:

put-software-name-here, like most mainstream open source software, is
available in the FreeBSD ports collection and can be installed as a binary
package on FreeBSD using the following command:

    pkg install put-package-name-here

Building and installing from source can also be easily performed using
the following:

    cd /usr/ports/category/put-port-name-here
    make install

This method allows building with non-default options in many cases.
