FreeBSD Users:

X, like most mainstream open source software, is available in the
FreeBSD ports system and can be installed as a binary package on
FreeBSD using the following command:

    pkg install X

Building and installing from source can also be easily performed using
the following:

    cd /usr/ports/category/X
    make install

This method allows building with non-default options in many cases.
