nonmritools - Metaport for non-MRI tools used in MRI research
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The
.B nonmritools
port is a metaport for installing a
collection of MRI research tools, including, for the current installation
on this system %%DEPENDS%%.

Some complex ports (e.g. OpenOffice.org, Firefox) are included in the menu,
but OFF by default.  I recommend installing these programs as PBIs if you
are running PC-BSD. Otherwise, turn them on when running "make install" for
the first time, or "make config".

.B nonmritools
metaport itself installs nothing other than this man page.  It consists
mainly of a list of dependencies for installing other ports useful for
MRI research.  The 
.B nonmritools
metaport may be safely removed without affecting any of the
dependent ports.  In fact, attempts to remove any of the dependents will
fail if 
.B nonmritools
is currently installed.  You can force removal of the dependent
port using "pkg_delete -f", or remove
.B nonmritools
first.

The default list of dependencies is fairly large, and the user may wish to
trim it down to the software they need, using "make config" or by editing the Makefile, before installing
.B nonmritools.

If
.B nonmritools
is already installed, and you want to change the set of installed programs,
run "make deinstall clean config reinstall".
